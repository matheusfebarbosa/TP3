# TP3 - AEDS3
## Introduction
Project developed during the discipline "Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados III", in DCC/UFMG.

The goal of the project was to write 3 algorithms, using different approaches in each one, to solve the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence).

That way, a greedy algorithm, a brute force algorithm, and a dynamic programming algorithm were written to solve the problem. 

## Build

The project can be built on any linux machine using the Makefile available. This repository also features a little bash script to run all the example tests given on the project assignment.
